## Introduction

The Tooling Expert mode is designed to help developers make informed decisions about which tools to use for their projects. It provides a structured approach to tool selection, taking into account project requirements, constraints, and objectives.

This mode is particularly useful when:
- Starting a new project and deciding on the tech stack
- Adding new functionality that requires additional libraries or frameworks
- Evaluating alternatives to existing tools
- Migrating from deprecated technologies
- Optimizing performance or addressing specific technical challenges

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Consultation

The mode begins with a thorough consultation to understand your specific needs:
- Task requirements (what you're trying to accomplish)
- Project type (web development, data science, game development, etc.)
- Constraints (performance, compatibility, budget, etc.)
- Objectives (short-term vs. long-term goals, scalability, etc.)

### 2. Flexible Information Gathering

To respect your token budget, the mode offers different information gathering approaches:
- **Quick Mode**: Relies primarily on built-in knowledge, minimal analysis
- **Standard Mode**: Balanced project analysis and targeted research
- **Comprehensive Mode**: Thorough analysis with extensive research

### 3. Customizable Evaluation

You can specify which factors are most important for your decision:
- Learning curve and developer experience
- Community support and ecosystem
- Performance and scalability
- Documentation quality
- Integration capabilities
- Maintenance status and future outlook
- Licensing and cost considerations

### 4. Detailed Recommendations

The mode provides clear, justified recommendations:
- Prioritized list of tools that best match your requirements
- Brief description of each recommended tool
- Key strengths and limitations
- Fit for your specific project requirements
- Implementation considerations
- Alternative options with trade-offs

### 5. Project-Aware Analysis

With your permission, the mode can analyze your existing project files to provide context-aware recommendations:
- Identify current technologies and dependencies
- Understand project structure and patterns
- Ensure compatibility with existing codebase
- Suggest integration approaches

## Consultation Process

The consultation follows a structured process:

1. **Initial Query**: You describe what you're looking for (e.g., "What's the best Python TUI library for creating an interactive dashboard?")

2. **Requirement Gathering**: The mode asks clarifying questions to understand your specific needs:
   - What are you trying to build?
   - What are your key requirements?
   - What constraints do you have?

3. **Information Gathering Preferences**: You select how much research should be done:
   - Quick Mode: Minimal analysis, token-efficient
   - Standard Mode: Balanced project analysis and research
   - Comprehensive Mode: Thorough analysis with extensive research

4. **Evaluation Criteria**: You specify which factors are most important for your decision

5. **Project Analysis** (optional): With your permission, the mode analyzes your project files

6. **Web Research** (optional): With your permission, the mode conducts web searches

7. **Recommendation Delivery**: The mode presents its recommendations in your preferred format

8. **Follow-up Support**: You can request more detailed analysis or implementation guidance

## Information Gathering Modes

### Quick Mode

- **Purpose**: Provide rapid recommendations with minimal token usage
- **Method**: Relies primarily on built-in knowledge
- **Best for**: Simple queries, tight token budgets, or when you need a starting point
- **Limitations**: May not include the latest tools or detailed comparisons

### Standard Mode

- **Purpose**: Balance thoroughness with efficiency
- **Method**: Combines project analysis with targeted web searches
- **Best for**: Most common tool selection scenarios
- **Limitations**: May not cover highly specialized or niche tools in depth

### Comprehensive Mode

- **Purpose**: Provide the most thorough analysis possible
- **Method**: Conducts extensive research using MCP tools
- **Best for**: Critical technology decisions or complex requirements
- **Limitations**: Higher token usage

## Evaluation Criteria

The mode can evaluate tools based on various criteria:

### Learning Curve and Developer Experience
- Ease of getting started
- Quality of developer experience
- Intuitiveness of API/interface
- Availability of examples and tutorials

### Community Support and Ecosystem
- Size and activity of community
- Availability of plugins/extensions
- Third-party integrations
- Stack Overflow presence

### Performance and Scalability
- Speed and efficiency
- Resource usage
- Ability to handle large workloads
- Concurrency support

### Documentation Quality
- Comprehensiveness
- Clarity and organization
- Code examples
- Tutorials and guides

### Integration Capabilities
- Compatibility with other tools
- API flexibility
- Extensibility
- Interoperability

### Maintenance Status
- Frequency of updates
- Issue resolution time
- Roadmap clarity
- Backward compatibility policy

### Licensing and Cost
- Open source vs. commercial
- License restrictions
- Pricing model
- Total cost of ownership

## Recommendation Format

Recommendations can be presented in different formats:

### Concise Format
- Brief list with key points
- Token-efficient
- Focus on top recommendations only
- Minimal justification

### Standard Format
- Detailed overview with pros/cons
- Balanced depth and breadth
- Comparison of top options
- Clear justifications

### Comprehensive Format
- In-depth analysis with implementation considerations
- Detailed comparisons
- Code examples where relevant
- Alternative options with trade-offs
- Migration considerations

## Use Cases

### 1. Frontend Framework Selection

When choosing a frontend framework, the mode will consider:
- Application complexity and scale
- Performance requirements
- Team experience
- SEO requirements
- Mobile support needs
- Server-side rendering requirements

### 2. Database Selection

When recommending a database, the mode will evaluate:
- Data structure (relational vs. document vs. graph)
- Query complexity
- Transaction requirements
- Scaling needs
- Consistency requirements
- Operational complexity

### 3. API Integration

When suggesting APIs, the mode will consider:
- Data requirements
- Rate limits and quotas
- Authentication methods
- Documentation quality
- Pricing models
- Reliability and uptime

### 4. Visualization Technology

When recommending visualization tools, the mode will assess:
- Data complexity and volume
- Interactivity requirements
- Customization needs
- Performance considerations
- Integration with existing stack
- Export/sharing capabilities

## Best Practices

To get the most out of the Tooling Expert mode:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you're trying to accomplish
2. **Provide Context**: Share relevant details about your project
3. **Prioritize Criteria**: Identify which factors matter most to you
4. **Start Broad**: Begin with a general query, then narrow down based on recommendations
5. **Request Examples**: Ask for code examples or implementation guidance for your specific use case
6. **Consider Alternatives**: Explore multiple options before making a decision
7. **Follow Up**: Ask for more details about specific tools that interest you

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Recommendations Too Generic**
   - Solution: Provide more specific requirements and constraints

2. **Missing Latest Tools**
   - Solution: Request the Comprehensive Mode with web research

3. **Conflicting Recommendations**
   - Solution: Clarify your priorities and evaluation criteria

4. **Implementation Guidance Too Vague**
   - Solution: Ask for specific code examples or switch to Code mode for implementation help

5. **Token Usage Concerns**
   - Solution: Use Quick Mode or request more concise responses
