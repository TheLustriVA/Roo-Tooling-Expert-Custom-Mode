# Example Consultation: Vector Database Selection for RAG

This example demonstrates how the Tooling Expert mode helps a user select the most appropriate vector database for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation.

## Initial Query

**User**: I'm building a RAG system that needs to handle about 1 million documents. Which vector database would be best for this?

## Consultation Process

**Tooling Expert**: I'd be happy to help you select the best vector database for your RAG system. To provide tailored recommendations, I'll need to understand your specific requirements better.

First, let me ask about your information gathering preference:
1. Quick Mode: Minimal analysis, token-efficient
2. Standard Mode: Balanced project analysis and research
3. Comprehensive Mode: Thorough analysis with extensive research

**User**: Comprehensive Mode

**Tooling Expert**: Excellent choice. For a comprehensive analysis, I'll need to gather detailed information about your requirements. Let's start with some key questions:

1. What type of documents will you be storing? (text, images, audio, etc.)
2. What's the average size of your documents or embeddings?
3. What embedding model are you planning to use? (OpenAI, Hugging Face, custom, etc.)
4. What are your query performance requirements? (latency expectations)
5. Do you need cloud-hosted, self-hosted, or hybrid deployment?
6. What's your expected query volume? (queries per second)
7. Do you have any specific integration requirements? (languages, frameworks)
8. What's your budget constraint for this component?

**User**: We're storing text documents, mostly research papers and technical documentation. Average document is about 10 pages. We're using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model (1536 dimensions). We need query latency under 200ms. We prefer self-hosted but could consider cloud options. Query volume will be moderate, maybe 5-10 QPS at peak. We're building in Python with FastAPI. Budget isn't a major constraint for the right solution.

**Tooling Expert**: Thank you for the detailed information. Let me also understand which factors are most important for your decision. Please rank these from most to least important:
1. Query performance (speed and relevance)
2. Scalability (ability to grow beyond 1M documents)
3. Ease of deployment and maintenance
4. Integration with your Python/FastAPI stack
5. Advanced search features (filtering, hybrid search)
6. Cost (infrastructure, licensing)

**User**: 1. Query performance
2. Advanced search features
3. Integration with our stack
4. Scalability
5. Ease of deployment
6. Cost

## Analysis and Recommendations

**Tooling Expert**: Based on your requirements and priorities, I've researched several vector databases suitable for RAG implementations. Here's my comprehensive analysis:

### 1. Weaviate (Recommended)

**Description**: Weaviate is an open-source vector database that allows you to store objects and vector embeddings from various ML models and create semantic relations between them.

**Key Strengths**:
- Excellent query performance with optimized HNSW indexing
- Rich feature set including hybrid search (vector + keyword), semantic search, and filters
- Native Python client with good FastAPI integration examples
- GraphQL API for complex queries
- Strong support for OpenAI embeddings
- Both self-hosted and cloud options available

**Fit for Your Requirements**:
- Optimized for text-embedding-ada-002 with 1536 dimensions
- Can easily handle 1M documents with sub-200ms query times
- Advanced filtering and hybrid search capabilities match your priority for advanced search features
- Excellent Python SDK with async support for FastAPI

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Requires Docker for self-hosted deployment
- Recommended hardware: 16GB+ RAM for 1M documents with your embedding size
- Consider using batch imports for initial data loading
- Implement caching for frequently accessed queries to improve performance

**Example Code Snippet**:
```python
import weaviate
from fastapi import FastAPI
import openai

app = FastAPI()

# Initialize Weaviate client
client = weaviate.Client(
    url="http://localhost:8080",
)

# FastAPI endpoint for RAG query
@app.get("/query/")
async def query(question: str):
    # Generate embedding for the question
    response = openai.Embedding.create(
        input=question,
        model="text-embedding-ada-002"
    )
    query_embedding = response['data'][0]['embedding']
    
    # Query Weaviate
    result = client.query.get(
        "Document",
        ["content", "title", "url"]
    ).with_near_vector({
        "vector": query_embedding,
        "certainty": 0.7
    }).with_limit(5).do()
    
    return result["data"]["Get"]["Document"]
```
