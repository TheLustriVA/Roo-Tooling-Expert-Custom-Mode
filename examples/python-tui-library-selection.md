# Example Consultation: Python TUI Library Selection

This example demonstrates how the Tooling Expert mode helps a user select the most appropriate Python TUI (Text User Interface) library for their project.

## Initial Query

**User**: I need to build a terminal-based dashboard for monitoring system metrics in real-time. What's the best Python TUI library for this?

## Consultation Process

**Tooling Expert**: I'd be happy to help you select the best Python TUI library for your real-time system monitoring dashboard. To provide the most relevant recommendations, I'll need to understand your requirements better.

First, let me ask about your information gathering preference:
1. Quick Mode: Minimal analysis, token-efficient
2. Standard Mode: Balanced project analysis and research
3. Comprehensive Mode: Thorough analysis with extensive research

**User**: Standard Mode

**Tooling Expert**: Great choice. Now, let's clarify your specific requirements:

1. What kind of system metrics will you be monitoring? (CPU, memory, network, custom metrics, etc.)
2. How complex will your UI be? (Multiple panels, graphs, tables, etc.)
3. How important is performance/resource usage for your application?
4. Do you have any specific Python version requirements?
5. Will other developers need to maintain this code?

**User**: I'll be monitoring CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network metrics. I need multiple panels with real-time graphs and tables. Performance is important since it will run on production servers. We're using Python 3.9+ and a team of 3 developers will maintain it.

**Tooling Expert**: Thanks for the details. Let me also understand which factors are most important for your decision. Please rank these from most to least important:
1. Performance and resource efficiency
2. Ease of creating complex layouts and widgets
3. Documentation quality and examples
4. Learning curve for your team
5. Active maintenance and community support

**User**: 1. Performance and resource efficiency
2. Ease of creating complex layouts and widgets
3. Active maintenance and community support
4. Documentation quality and examples
5. Learning curve for our team

## Analysis and Recommendations

**Tooling Expert**: Based on your requirements and priorities, here are my recommendations for Python TUI libraries for your real-time system monitoring dashboard:

### 1. Textual (Recommended)

**Description**: Textual is a modern TUI framework for Python that allows you to build rich, responsive terminal applications with a component-based architecture similar to modern web frameworks.

**Key Strengths**:
- Excellent performance with minimal resource overhead
- Rich widget set including built-in graphs, tables, and progress indicators
- Powerful layout system with CSS-like styling
- Active development with frequent updates
- Growing community and ecosystem

**Fit for Your Requirements**:
- Well-suited for complex dashboards with multiple panels
- Built-in support for real-time updates and animations
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Modern API that will be familiar to developers with web experience

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Requires Python 3.7+
- Uses the Rich library under the hood for rendering
- Reactive programming model for handling real-time updates

**Example Code Snippet**:
```python
from textual.app import App
from textual.widgets import Header, Footer, DataTable, BarChart
from textual.containers import Container, Grid

class SystemMonitorApp(App):
    def compose(self):
        yield Header()
        yield Grid(
            Container(DataTable(id="cpu_table"), id="cpu_panel"),
            Container(BarChart(id="memory_chart"), id="memory_panel"),
            Container(DataTable(id="disk_table"), id="disk_panel"),
            Container(BarChart(id="network_chart"), id="network_panel"),
            id="dashboard"
        )
        yield Footer()

    async def on_mount(self):
        # Set up real-time data collection and update
        self.set_interval(1.0, self.update_metrics)
    
    async def update_metrics(self):
        # Update the UI with new metrics
        # ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app = SystemMonitorApp()
    app.run()
```

### 2. Urwid

**Description**: Urwid is a mature, console user interface library for Python that includes many features useful for text console application developers.

**Key Strengths**:
- Extremely efficient with minimal resource usage
- Stable and battle-tested in production environments
- Powerful widget set with custom drawing capabilities
- Excellent for complex, nested layouts

**Fit for Your Requirements**:
- Highly optimized performance for resource-constrained environments
- Capable of handling complex layouts and real-time updates
- Long history of use in system monitoring applications

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Steeper learning curve compared to newer libraries
- Less modern API design
- Requires more boilerplate code for common tasks

### 3. Rich

**Description**: Rich is a Python library for rich text and beautiful formatting in the terminal, with a high-level Console interface.

**Key Strengths**:
- Excellent rendering capabilities for tables, progress bars, and syntax highlighting
- Very good performance characteristics
- Extensive documentation and examples
- Can be used alongside other libraries

**Fit for Your Requirements**:
- Great for displaying complex data in tables and charts
- Good performance for real-time updates
- Simple API for basic use cases

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Not a complete TUI framework by itself (though it powers Textual)
- Would need additional code for layout management
- Better for simpler interfaces or as a component in a larger application

### 4. Blessed

**Description**: Blessed is a thin, practical wrapper around terminal capabilities in Python, providing elegant, well-documented terminal output.

**Key Strengths**:
- Lightweight with minimal dependencies
- Low-level control over terminal features
- Good performance characteristics

**Fit for Your Requirements**:
- Minimal resource overhead
- Provides building blocks for custom interfaces

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Requires more custom code to build complex interfaces
- Less structured approach to application development
- Fewer high-level widgets available out of the box

## Conclusion

Based on your requirements—particularly the need for performance, complex layouts with real-time graphs and tables, and active maintenance—**Textual** is the recommended choice. It offers the best balance of performance, ease of development for complex interfaces, and active community support.

If absolute minimal resource usage is critical, **Urwid** would be a strong alternative, though with a steeper learning curve and more development time required.
